# pomodoro-timer
Pomodoro timer from HTML, CSS, JS. I've always used pomodoro timers on my computer. I used a Google Extenssion for it throughout high school that help me focus so I thought why not let's try building this. 
Thanks to the https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G (Frontend Mentor Challenge), I was able to learn how to do this.s
